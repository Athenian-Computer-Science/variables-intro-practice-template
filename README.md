# Lesson 3 Practice (Variables Intro)

Use this repository (repo, for short) to complete your practice for Lesson 3.

## Complete the following:
#### Edpuzzle
* [Edpuzzle practice](src/edpuzzle_practice.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * Use this for practice during the Edpuzzle video. You can use the main window or the Python Console (see button at the bottom of the PyCharm window)

#### Quick check
On Canvas, complete the Quick check. Note any misconceptions/missed questions in OneNote, along with explanations/clarifications.

#### Parsons Puzzles  
* [Parsons Puzzle: variable reassignment](https://athenian-computer-science.github.io/hosting-parsons-on-github-template/parsons/variable-reassignment.html) ðŸ¥‰

#### Fix & Write Code  
* [Fix the Code: Rectangle Perimeter](src/rectangle_perimeter.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * **Description:** This program should calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, but it has some errors. Find and fix the errors so it runs correctly. Be sure to output is formatted to match the expected output! 
  * **Pseudocode:** 
    * Get base and height of rectangle (assume integer values)
    * Calculate perimeter and assign the value to a variable
    * Print a message that includes the calculated perimeter.
    * The message should read: `"The perimeter of the rectangle is ___."`, where ___ is the calculated value.
* **Example:** (user input in parentheses)
  ```buildoutcfg
  Base: (5)
  Height: (10)
  Output: The perimeter of the rectangle is 30.
  ```
* **Check your work:**
Run your program a few times to be sure it is working correctly. Remember to check your results, too, to be sure you don't have semantic errors. Also, double-check that your output is formatted correctly since that will casue problems with the GitHub testing. 

### Submitting this repo
